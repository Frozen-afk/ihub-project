🔍 AI-Powered Image & Video Search (CLIP-Based)
Search your **phone’s gallery** with natural language — like magic.  
Just type what you're looking for, and the model will find the most relevant **image** (and soon, **video**) from your gallery using powerful AI (CLIP by OpenAI).

📸 Features
✅ Search with plain text (e.g. “a cat”, “a red car”, “a beach”)  
✅ Works with **any number** of images  
✅ Instant results with highest visual match  
✅ Uses **CLIP** (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining)  
🛠️ Future support: **video preview & retrieval** (via keyframes)  

📱 Use Case
“You took hundreds of photos on vacation — but now can’t find that picture of the sunset or the café dog. Just type: `sunset on the beach` or `a dog in a cafe` and the app finds it.”

🧠 How It Works
1. You give a **text prompt**: `"a cute puppy"`
2. The model encodes that text using CLIP
3. It compares your prompt to all image embeddings in your gallery
4. The closest match is displayed

How to use
1.Put Images in gallery/

2.Run the code

3.It will prompt:What are you looking for?

4.Type something like:A photo of a cat

5.It will show you the best match!
